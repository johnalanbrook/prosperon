# Entities

Entities are defined by creating a .jso script in your game directory. Variants of the original entity can be created by defining a .json file, typically done via the provided editor. The original entity is known as its ur-type. If you create a player.jso file in your game directory, a player can be spawned by saying Primum.spawn(ur.player).

An entity which differs from its ur will have an asterisk * next to its name.
