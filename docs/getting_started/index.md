# Getting Started

## Installation
### Linux & MacOS
Install the most [[https://prosperon.dev/download][recent binaries]] into your `$PATH`.

### Windows
Copy the executable into any folder and run it. If no game is deteced, it scaffolds for you.

### Building
You will need `sokol-shdc` in the top of your directory. Then, `make shaders` and `make`. The command `make install` copies it to your home's `.bin` path.

## Playing your first game
Download any of the completed example projects. Run `prosperon play` in the folder.

Poke around the example projects. You will find it refreshingly straight forward.
