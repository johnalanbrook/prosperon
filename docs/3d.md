# Yugine 3D Tooling

  Yowza! 3D graphical features include:

  ### Rendering
  A forward rendering pipeline with MSAA options.

  ### Debug modes
  Grid drawing is handled as three separate axises. Most game engines enable the X and Z axis drawing to create a 2D grid on the ground. Each axis has markers for a set number of units so you can orient yourself whereever you are in the game world. You set these markers.

  If you only enable the X axis grid, there will just be a line along the X axis that shows you the units you're at. X and Z enabled create a 2D grid on the ground; X, Y and Z enabled create a grid going into the sky as well as the grid along theh ground.
