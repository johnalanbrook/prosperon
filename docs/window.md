# Rendering & Window

## 2D

For a 2D game, you should use sprites for which are the highest resolution you wish to target.

While designing the game, a 'native' resolution should be selected. One unit in the game world is equivalent to one display pixel, so this resolution should be selected based on the 'look' of the game you are going for.
