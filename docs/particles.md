# Particle system

The particle system works in conjunction with script.

They are CPU-based particles, which enable a greater amount of particle interactivity thando GPU-based particles.

The particles are based on a node system. Particles can have a new set of parameters at different stages of its life.

Each particle can be individually queried for position, angle, life, and so on.

Emitters and even individual particles can have specific callback functions applied for death, birth, and more.
